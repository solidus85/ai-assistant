- Commit changes to git every time changes are made.
- Keep programming file line count below 300-400 lines.  Split into multiple files when necessary.
- Avoid creating md files, simply communicate to me and I will tell you if I want your comments serialized.
- All configurable settings or variables should be saved in config.py.
