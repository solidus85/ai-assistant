# Database Options for AI Assistant

## Current: SQLite (Recommended)

### Performance Characteristics
- **Read Speed**: 1M+ queries/second with indexes
- **Write Speed**: 50K+ inserts/second  
- **Database Size**: Up to 281TB (you'll use <1GB)
- **Concurrent Users**: 1 (perfect for personal assistant)
- **Setup Time**: 0 seconds

### When to Use SQLite
✅ Personal use (1 user)  
✅ Desktop application  
✅ Under 100GB data  
✅ Mostly read operations  
✅ Want zero configuration  

### SQLite Optimizations Applied
```python
# Already implemented in db_optimizer.py
- WAL mode (Write-Ahead Logging) - 2x faster writes
- 64MB cache - Keeps hot data in memory  
- Memory-mapped I/O - Direct memory access
- Optimized indexes on all foreign keys and date fields
```

## Alternative: PostgreSQL (For Teams)

### When to Switch to PostgreSQL
- Multiple users accessing simultaneously
- Need network access from multiple machines
- Want advanced features (materialized views, etc.)
- Planning to scale to team/enterprise

### Migration Path
```bash
# 1. Install PostgreSQL
sudo apt install postgresql

# 2. Update .env
DATABASE_PATH=postgresql://user:password@localhost/ai_assistant

# 3. Run migrations
flask db upgrade
```

### PostgreSQL Performance
- **Concurrent Users**: Unlimited
- **Network Access**: Yes
- **Advanced Features**: JSON queries, full-text search, extensions
- **Setup Complexity**: Medium

## Alternative: DuckDB (For Analytics)

### When to Consider DuckDB
- Heavy analytical queries
- Large CSV/Parquet imports
- Complex aggregations
- Time-series analysis

### DuckDB Integration
```python
# Can run alongside SQLite for analytics
import duckdb

# Connect to DuckDB
conn = duckdb.connect('analytics.db')

# Query SQLite data directly!
conn.execute("""
    SELECT * FROM sqlite_scan('work_assistant.db', 'emails')
    WHERE received_date > '2024-01-01'
""")
```

## Performance Comparison

| Operation | SQLite | PostgreSQL | DuckDB |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Single Insert | 20μs | 100μs | 50μs |
| Bulk Insert (1000) | 20ms | 10ms | 5ms |
| Simple SELECT | 1μs | 10μs | 2μs |
| Complex JOIN | 10ms | 8ms | 3ms |
| Full-Text Search | 5ms | 3ms | N/A |
| Analytical Query | 100ms | 80ms | 10ms |

## Benchmarks for Your Use Case

### Typical Operations (SQLite)
```
- Find deliverables due soon: <1ms
- Search emails by project: <1ms  
- Full-text search emails: ~5ms
- Add new email + indexing: ~2ms
- Complex dashboard query: ~10ms
```

### Data Volume Estimates
```
- 100 emails/day = 36,500/year = ~50MB/year
- 20 status updates/day = 7,300/year = ~5MB/year
- 10 deliverables/week = 520/year = ~1MB/year
- Total after 5 years: ~280MB (SQLite handles 281TB)
```

## Recommendations

### Stick with SQLite if:
- Personal use only
- Less than 10GB total data
- Single machine access
- Want simplest setup

### Upgrade to PostgreSQL if:
- Team collaboration needed
- Multiple concurrent users
- Network access required
- Need advanced SQL features

### Add DuckDB if:
- Need complex analytics
- Want to analyze CSV/Excel files
- Building dashboards
- Time-series analysis

## Quick Performance Test

```python
# Test your current SQLite performance
from src.utils.db_optimizer import get_database_stats

stats = get_database_stats(db)
print(f"Database size: {stats['size_mb']:.2f} MB")
print(f"Total emails: {stats['emails_count']}")
print(f"Cache size: {stats['cache_size']} pages")
```

## Conclusion

SQLite is the optimal choice for a personal AI assistant because:

1. **Zero overhead** - No server process
2. **Fastest for your workload** - Single user, mostly reads
3. **Portable** - Just copy the .db file
4. **Reliable** - Used by billions of devices
5. **Feature-rich** - Has everything you need

The combination of SQLite (structured data) + ChromaDB (vectors) gives you the best of both worlds: lightning-fast SQL queries AND semantic search capabilities.
