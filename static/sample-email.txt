Subject: Q1 2024 Platform Migration Update

Team,

I'm writing to provide an important update on our cloud platform migration project.

PROJECT STATUS:
We are currently at 60% completion with the following milestones achieved:

COMPLETED TASKS:
* Database migration to PostgreSQL (completed by David and his team)
* Microservices architecture implementation for core services
* CI/CD pipeline setup with Jenkins
* Security audit phase 1 passed

IN PROGRESS:
* API gateway configuration (Alice working on this, 80% done)
* Load balancer setup (Bob handling, expected completion Friday)
* Data migration scripts (Charlie's team, 50% complete)

BLOCKERS:
- Legacy system integration is taking longer than expected
- Need additional AWS credits for testing environment
- Waiting on security team approval for production deployment

UPCOMING DELIVERABLES:
* Technical documentation - Due March 15
* Performance benchmarks report - Due March 20
* Go-live checklist - Due March 25
* Production deployment - Target: April 1

RESOURCE NEEDS:
We need two additional backend engineers to meet our April 1 deadline. 
I've discussed this with HR and they're actively recruiting.

ACTION ITEMS:
1. All team leads please update your progress in Jira by EOD
2. Security team needs to schedule the phase 2 audit ASAP
3. DevOps team to provision staging environment by next Monday
4. QA team to prepare test cases for integration testing

The migration is critical for our Q2 product launches. We're facing some challenges 
but I'm confident we can meet our deadline with focused effort from everyone.

Please review the attached architecture diagrams and provide feedback by Wednesday.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Michael
